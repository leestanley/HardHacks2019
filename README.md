# Noggin Login - HardHacks2019

Rooms with over a large amount of people are a big problem when it comes to safety hazards. How can we find an efficent way of counting the number of people in a room in order to ensure safety? By creating an automated counting system, Noggin Login is a more precise and effective way of doing *exactly* this!

# Motivation
As first-time college students, we were shocked by the size of the lecture halls. We quickly saw how much effort it took to take attendence in class. There are also instances of students sitting on the steps of classes with waitlists, which. We all complain about the cost of iClickers, and installing this head count camera would reduce the the money needed in your college fund. Without needing to thinking about this extra investment, we could all focus on our education and get the best out of our experience in college.

# Installation
Installation
- Download the repository
- Install pip, OpenCV, imutils, and pySerial
- Download the Arduino IDE

# Features
- Head counter that adds up the total amount of people in a room
- Arduino with an LCD displaying the live count of people

# Challenges
- Connecting the Python data of head counts to display on the LCD attached to the Arduino
- Figuring out the correct algorithm to increment and decrement the amount of people that is detected
- Understanding the functions of an Arduino

# Extensions
- Printing out the number of people onto the LCD
- Website that would potentially braodcast a live count of the people in a room
